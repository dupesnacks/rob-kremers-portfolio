RORK IMPLEMENTATION BRIEF: Explorer Avatar Sizing & Interactivity

FEATURE: Make explorer avatar more prominent on Journey screen

CURRENT STATE:
- Explorer avatar displayed in top-left corner of journey map
- Avatar is ~60-80px, easily missed by kids
- Currently static (no interaction)

DESIRED STATE:
Option A: **Bigger by Default** (Recommended for kids 3-10)
- Increase explorer avatar to 120-140px
- Position in top-left with better padding
- Add subtle glow or neon outline (matches brand: cyan #00d9ff or purple #667eea)
- Makes character visible & identifiable at a glance

Option B: **Tappable Expansion** (More interactive)
- Keep explorer at 100px default
- Tappable button with ripple effect
- On tap: Modal/fullscreen view of explorer (512x512 illustration)
- Show explorer name, personality type, level
- Modal has "Got it!" or "Back" button
- Smooth slide-in animation

RECOMMENDATION:
Implement **Option A + subtle tap affordance** (best of both):
1. Default size: 120px (3x larger)
2. Glow/border: Cyan neon (#00d9ff) or dynamic color
3. Tappable: Opens explorer detail modal (Option B)
4. Modal shows: Full avatar, name, personality, current streak/achievements
5. Animation: Slide-in from top-left, fade-out on dismiss

VISUAL SPECS:
- Avatar container: 120px x 120px
- Border: 2px solid #00d9ff with glow (box-shadow)
- Background: rgba(0, 217, 255, 0.1)
- Border-radius: 12px
- Padding: 8px
- On hover/tap: Slightly scale up (1.05x), brighten glow
- Modal backdrop: Semi-transparent dark (rgba(0,0,0,0.7))

CONTENT IN MODAL:
- Large explorer image (400x400px)
- Name (e.g., "Cosmo")
- Type (e.g., "Science Explorer")
- Personality (e.g., "Curious, thoughtful, loves understanding how things work")
- Current Level (e.g., "Level 5 - Galaxy Legend")
- Streak count (optional, if available)
- Close button: "Back to Journey"

INTERACTION:
- Tap anywhere outside modal to close (or close button)
- Smooth fade transition
- No animation lag on mobile

This makes kids feel connected to their chosen explorer while keeping the journey map uncluttered.
